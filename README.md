# Tele-Operated Robotics Platform
This repo outlines the documentation for a tele-operated threaded mini-tank robot system. The robot is controlled with a radio-controller, that sends it's signals to the tank. This will interpret the signals and run it's two DC motors with required PWM signals.
This repo documents the implementation of a treaded robot platform controlled with a RC link. The system interprets RC inputs to generate appropiate PWM signals for it's two DC motors, enabling tank-style steering and locomotion.
